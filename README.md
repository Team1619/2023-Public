# rs_framework_dev
This project contains all of the framework projects along with the robot projects

This allows one to upate and test the framework projects or compare robot projects.

The resulting framework jar files should be copied into the rs_framework_libs repository so one can work with individual robot projects without the need of using this rs_framework_dev project. This is good for rookies as they don't have as much code to deal with at one time.

To get started run setup.sh from inside Intellij or double click setup.bat in Windows File Explorer, to pull all of the individual projects from GitHub.
 
Finally refresh gradle from inside Intellij, and you are ready to start working on the framework.
